# SwiftStarterProject

## Overview
This iOS Skeleton Project serves as a template for kickstarting new applications. It implements Clean Architecture principles, providing a robust structure for building scalable and maintainable applications. The project follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern for state management, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and simplifying testing and management of application logic.

## Key Features
- **Clean Architecture**: Organized layers of code that separate presentation, domain, and data, making the app easier to maintain and extend.
- **MVVM Pattern**: Promotes a clear separation between the UI and business logic, enhancing testability and maintainability.
- **Localization Support**: Supports multiple languages, allowing users to interact in their preferred language. Easily add new languages and manage translations.
- **Onboarding Flow**: Guides users through the app's features with a streamlined onboarding process, improving first-time user experience.
- **Dependency Injection**: Utilizes the Resolver library for efficient dependency management. This setup simplifies testing, increases flexibility, and adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle by decoupling object creation from business logic.
